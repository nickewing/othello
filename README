Othello
By Nick Ewing

Overview
========
Contained in this archive is an implementation of the board game
Othello.  The game supports Human vs. Computer or Human vs. Human play
(and technically Computer vs. Computer, but not through the GUI).
The easy difficulty is simply a random strategy, the medium difficulty
is a greedy strategy and the hard difficulty is a minimax algorithm
with alpha-beta pruning.

Building/Running
================
To build and run, use open the XCode project and select Build and Run
from the menu.

Operations
==========
The game can be played through the main window.  Player and difficulty
settings are available through the File menu.

Known Problems
==============
The "hard" difficulty (the default difficulty) is seemingly less
difficult than the "medium" difficulty.  It seems the deeper the agent
looks into possible future moves, the worse its decisions get.  The
algorithm has been checked thoroughly leaving the most likely cause
to be some unknown aspect of the game not being represented by the
scoring or weighting system.
